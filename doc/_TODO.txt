common/string.h
 - string with platform-defined internal representation
   (UTF-16 on Windows, UTF-8 on Linux), auto converting
 - use for paths and everything
    - options?
    - node.cpp/raddi.com.cpp -> main args?

POW!!!
 - COMPRESSROUND reduces edge representation from > 4bytes to 4 bytes when #remaining edges is small enough to allow it.

 - XBITS determines granularity of bucketsort (using 2XBITS
 - SAVEEDGES allows instant recovery of edge indices of solutions, at cost of extra 1GB memory
    - so OFF?

perfect compression dictionary for english text
 - add dots, commas etc with space at the end?
