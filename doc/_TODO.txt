github/raddi/raddi-builds-windows/release/installer.exe
 - uac: highest available, if not elevated, global installation will prompt
 - check for MSVC
    - if redist exe present, and elevated, run redist install (or update) /install /passive /norestart
    - if not present, redirect user to download if not installed, or warn if very old
    - if not present, and not elevated, ask user to install portable build?
 - options (use tree):
    - program files / app data
    - service / on demand
       - option to open service settings before first run
    - core / normal / leaf
    - shortcuts: for all users / just for me
 - update function
    - shutdown instances (other users/sessions?)

threads are inserted duplicated (race condition?)

commands: loglevels
commands: optimize
commands: list:peers...
raddi.com analyze/get/list -> support decompression

warrant cannary channel
general link comments channel

bootstrap:dns://n0.raddi.net - resolve IP through DNS, TODO: try cn1, cn2, cn3, etc...

outbound data sorting in raddi::connection::send
 - prioritize shorter entries
 - random delay for origin masking (longer for longer messages)

report bad inputs (from source) in node

tables: test and fix shard splitting
tables: add code for client app to process external changes, see 'process' member function
tables: evaluate proper size limits so the index files fit exactly within whole multiples of a typical cluster size

perfect compression dictionary for english text
 - https://sourceforge.net/p/lzmautils/discussion/708858/thread/e40fbf99/
 - 1) open reddit export and extract body string
   2) replace unicode (\u1234) and escapes (\n or \") with actual unicode/control characters
   3) split to words (keep apostrophed words like can't or can\u2019t)
   4) for 'en' dictitonary drop words with unicode characters in it except \u2019 (maybe other?)
   5) compute freqency of words -> value
   6) reduce: remove words found in other words (affect value: avg, sum or max?)
   7) clamp: delete low values words, keep only reasonable amount of high-value words
   Z) combine: to one long string, asc sorting by value, with removing words found inside the newly combined string
 - evaluate gains of shuffling various similarly-valued words in order to 
 - compress initial bodies with established dictionary, report results, try different dictionaries, compare results

title/sidebar edits must be retained forever and forwarded to all users
 - or just force moderators to occassionally update them with fresh non-edit entry?

historical data replay flooding protection in raddi::db::classify case
 - start rejecting old entries from connection that we did not asked (connection->history_extension)

app: master phrase/password to protect keys + misdirection phrase/password for plausible deniability unlocks different set of account
 - generates safety hash such as
    - pwd1 + hash -> main key
    - pwd2 + hash -> safety key

sane coordinator status display
more info into overview

move connection::request_limiter to separate class

connection members will probably need locking to protect from early deletion when retired

old data deletion (whole shards?) except 'retained' channels/threads

coordinator: congestion control
coordinator: small random delay to sends to harden agains origin analysis -> connection.send
connection::send -> prioritization and delay support
coordinator: support for 'flags' 0x0001 (detail request) in channel/identites history and subscriptions history

merge raddi::detached, raddi::noticed and raddi::subscriptions
 - maybe one base template with 3 specializations

split raddi stuff from node.cpp to raddi_node.cpp
 - rename node.cpp to node_win.cpp and keep all Win32/service stuff there

rewrite log as noted in log.cpp or somewhere there in comment

SETTINGS GUIDE: settings for most privacy concerned users, first run (proxy, tor, listeners, xor-mask)

common/string.h
 - string with platform-defined internal representation
   (UTF-16 on Windows, UTF-8 on Linux), auto converting
 - use for paths and everything
    - options?
    - node.cpp/raddi.com.cpp -> main args?
 - AND THEN DROP ALL wchar_t* OVERLOADS

consider http server? simple GET/POST support
 - also replace Source/commands functionality
 - POST - new identity/channel/post/etc.
 - GET - db queries? lists of identities/channels
       - deep tree data fetch?
       - get node status (for status button/iframe on website)

document protocol
 - requirement: synchronized time
