TODO: Is it possible to prove that encrypted message contains certain plaintext without revealing or compromising decryption key
TODO: not yet subscribe/unsub done -> node running in core mode

github repo:
 - raddi-builds-windows
   - release - installer exe in release, separated exe/dlls in subdirs
   - portable

common/string.h
 - string with platform-defined internal representation
   (UTF-16 on Windows, UTF-8 on Linux), auto converting
 - use for paths and everything
    - options?
    - node.cpp/raddi.com.cpp -> main args?

perfect compression dictionary for english text
 - https://sourceforge.net/p/lzmautils/discussion/708858/thread/e40fbf99/
 - 1) open reddit export and extract body string
   2) replace unicode (\u1234) and escapes (\n or \") with actual unicode/control characters
   3) split to words (keep apostrophed words like can't or can\u2019t)
   4) for 'en' dictitonary drop words with unicode characters in it except \u2019 (maybe other?)
   5) compute freqency of words -> value
   6) reduce: remove words found in other words (affect value: avg, sum or max?)
   7) clamp: delete low values words, keep only reasonable amount of high-value words
   Z) combine: to one long string, asc sorting by value, with removing words found inside the newly combined string
 - evaluate gains of shuffling various similarly-valued words in order to 
 - compress initial bodies with established dictionary, report results, try different dictionaries, compare results

TODO: consider requiring vote codes and such to be outside of compressed parts?

cache of detached entries

merge raddi::detached, raddi::noticed and raddi::subscriptions
