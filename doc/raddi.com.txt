raddi.com
=========

What's in the name: Using .com extension on Windows I can have two raddi executables,
one for command-line utility, raddi.com, and one for GUI, raddi.exe, and shell selects
always the right one.
From command line, .com is used when typing "raddi timestamp", from Explorer the .exe
gets icon hinting user to click on it.

raddi.com usage examples
========================								|

NOTES:
	For all command-line parameters see parameters.txt, most importantly note that
	display:all parameter works for raddi.com too.

	Each entry (identity, channel, thread, post, etc...) broadcast onto the network
	needs to carry proof-of-work which takes some time, and significant CPU/memory
	resources, to create. Usually just a few seconds.

	raddi.com won't work unless you run node software which is successfully connected
	to the network. The node will attempt to broadcast the content anyway, but issues
	a warning that it might not have got reliably through.

Creating new identity
---------------------

	raddi new:identity "text:My awesome nickname"

Sample result:

	a76c4bf9eeb95e:8a33d1a4dbdde93fa0383e8e6caa47dd2f85f11b50d6c501f5bde438396be284

First part (before colon) is the identity identifier, second part is your private key.
Save this, don't share it :) You'll need this string for everything. You may create as
many identities as you want though.

The identity's public key is broadcast onto the network which should start accepting your
messages within a few moments.
Note that your identity is also your personal channel, but you should prefer to create
named channels.

NOTE (TODO: in HTML hide this behind progressive disclosure):
	The identity identifier is unique in the network. This uniqueness is established
	partly by using current timestamp. While it's possible to skew the PC's RTC clock
	and generate old-looking or slightly-in-the-future identity, you always want to
	use the actual time, otherwise, in the first case, you are risking collision with
	older existing account (and existing account will always win), and, in the second
	case, your identity could get ignored by core nodes with too slightly skewed RTC.

Creating new channel
--------------------

	raddi new:channel text:Stuff identity:xxxxx:zzzzzzzzzz

	// replace 'xxxxx:zzzzzzzzzz' with the result of identity creation.

Sample result:

Creating new thread
-------------------

	raddi new:thread channel:a76c4bf9eeb95e-eeb980 text:Abc identity:xxxxx:zzzzzzzzzz

Sample result:

	a76c2bf9eeb95e-eeb9ca

TBD

Posting reply
-------------

	raddi reply:a76c2bf9eeb95e-eeb9ca text:Reply identity:xxxxx:zzzzzzzzzz

Sample result:

	a76c2bf9eeb95e-eebaf1

TBD

Listing known identities
------------------------

	raddi list:identities

TBD
NOTE long list, use 'oldest' and 'latest' parameters

Listing known channels
----------------------

	raddi list:channels

TBD
NOTE long list, use 'oldest' and 'latest' parameters
