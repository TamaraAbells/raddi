STREAMING
=========

TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO
NOTHING OF THIS IS IMPLEMENTED

stream entries all share same ID

entry::proof must either contain distinguishing bit
 ...or first entry with valid proof marks itself as a stream announcement
    and streaming-enabled nodes and subscribers will ignore PoW which will
    actually contain out-of-band data (sync, order, keyframing, timestamps, ...)

only explicit subscribers of streams are getting them
