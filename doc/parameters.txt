Command-line parameters
=======================

Notes:
	- parameters may be optionally introduced by '/' or any number of '-' characters,
	  neither is necessary though
	- parameters that take boolean value, usually denoted with <0|1|false|true> below
	  are generally false by default, unless specified otherwise; when specified
	  without value, true is assumed

Common parameters:
	- log:<default|all|everything|event(s)|data|error(s)|stop(s)|disable(d)>[:<path>]
		- selects events written into the log file
		- level - one of predefined strings:
			- "default" - uses default log level, currently "error"
			- "disable" or "disabled" - logs nothing
			- "all" or "everything" - all events, even frequent status notes
			- "event" or "events" - significant runtime events and all below
			- "data" - malformed/invalid data processed and all below
			- "error" or "errors" - recoverable runtime errors and below
			- "stop" or "stops" - logs irrecoverable errors
		- path is optional path to log
	- display:<default|all|everything|event(s)|data|error(s)|stop(s)|disable(d)>
		- selects events displayed to console when started as application
		- parameter is same as log level
			- default display level is "events"
	- protocol:<text>
		- sets 8 bytes long protocol magic string that prevents connects between
		  incompatible versions; can be used to establish whole separate network
		- text parameter is converted to UTF-8 and truncated or NUL-padded to 8
		  bytes
			- default is: RADDI/1

Node parameters:
	- threads:<n>
		- number of worker threads the node service should use
		- when 0 (default) a 3 threads are started for each 2 logical processors
		  capping on 1/8 way from 'connections' to 'max-connections'
	- listen:<IP:port>
	- listen:<port>
	- listen:off
		- request to listen on IP address and port, IPv4 and IPv6 are allowed
		- for port only, two (IPv4 and IPv6) listeners are started
		- if not specified, listeners are started on default port 44303
		   - unless 'listen:off' (or invalid listen parameter) is provided
	- discovery:<IP:port>
	- discovery:<port>
	- discovery:off
		- starts local peer discovery on IP address and port, similar to 'listen'
		- for port only, two (IPv4 and IPv6) discoverers are started
		- if not specified, local peer discovery is started on default port 44303
		   - unless 'discovery:off' (or invalid discovery parameter) is provided
	- source:<path>
		- directory for files with entries for transmission
	- database:<name|path>
		- the path may be relative to default storage (name) or absolute (path)
		- default name is "database"
	- bootstrap:<URL>
	- bootstrap:off
		- while starting downloads and parses (plain text files) provided URL(s)
		  for IP addresses and adds those to database as core-level peer nodes
		- more than one URL can be provided by repeating the parameter
		- if none provided, the node will use default URL only if the local core
		  level peer nodes list is empty
			- default URL is: https://www.raddi.net/bootstrap.txt
	- bootstrap-proxy:<name>
		- if present, bootstrap URL is accessed through proxy
		- if name is omitted, the default system-configured proxy is used
	- bootstrap-user-agent:<user-agent-string>
		- replaces user-agent string used when accessing bootstrap URLs
		- default user agent string is "RADDI/1.0" where 1.0 represents current
		  version of the software
	- proxy:<port|IP:port>
		- specifies SOCKS5t (Tor) proxy; support for optimistic data is REQUIRED
		- default SOCKS5t proxy IP address is 127.0.0.1:9050
		- notes:
			- local network addresses are not routed through proxy
			- Tor Browser opens port 9150 instead of 9050 (expert bundle)
		- for maximum anonymity consider using along with following options:
			- "bootstrap:off" or "bootstrap-proxy:..."
			- "discovery:off" to prevent local network connections
			- "listen:off" so the node doesn't advertise listening port
		- no proxy is used by default, if the parameter is omitted
	- aes:<auto(matic)|disable(d)|force(d)>
		- adjusts how node selects between AES256-GCM and XChaCha20-Poly1305
		- value: one of predefined strings:
			- "auto" - uses AES when supported by both parties,
				   XChaCha20-Poly1305 otherwise
			- "disabled" - always uses XChaCha20-Poly1305
			- "forced" - disconnects peers that don't support AES256-GCM
	- network-propagation-participation:<0|1|false|true>
		- selects if node participates in network propagation, i.e. subscribes to
		  receive all traffic and store/rebroadcast it where appropriate in order
 		  to ensure the network health
		- generally users with data plan should disable this feature to conserve
		  bandwidth, preferably by using the 'leaf' option
		- default is true
	- channels-synchronization-participation:<0|1|false|true>
		- determines whether the node responds to identity/channels history query
		  with data batch that it has determined the peer has incomplete; this is
		  often substantial amount of data
		- generally users with data plan should disable this feature to conserve
		  bandwidth, preferably by using the 'leaf' option
		- default is true
	- full-database-downloads:<0|1|false|true>
		- allows peers to query and download all data, regardless of channels,
		  currently in local database
		- generally used by core nodes to fully synchronize among themselves, not
		  to be used by privacy concerned users as it can reveal subscriptions
		  and accounts connected to a particular IP address
		- default is false
	- full-database-download-limit:<#>
		- responses to full database download requests will never return data
		  older than this limit, regardless of request's threshold
		- default is 62 days (62 * 86400 seconds)
	- proof-complexity-requirements-adjustment:<#>
		- adjusts (increases or decreases) minimal required PoW complexity for
		  both identity/channels (default 27) and other entries (default 26)
		- prepared for use in future where mainstream PCs could spam the network
		- default is 0
	- keep-alive:<N>
		- specifies how long after last received data are peer connections probed
		  to ensure connected status
		- default value is 60000, i.e. 60 seconds; zero disables keep-alives
		- NOTE: non-zero values smaller than 1000 may not work
	- core
		- affected options:
			- database-store-everything = 1
			- full-database-downloads = 1
	- leaf
		- affected options:
			- max-core-connections += 1
			- min-core-connections += 1
			- network-propagation-participation = false
			- channels-synchronization-participation = false

Node database behavior parameters:
	- database-reinsertion-validation:<0|1|false|true>
		- when non-zero, repeatedly received entries are validated against data
		  already in database
		- default is 0 for release builds, 1 for debug builds
	- database-backtrack-granularity:<seconds>
		- specifies relative difference of a newly created shard's base timestamp
		  when database receives entry older than oldest entry already present
		- default is 4×86400 i.e. four days
	- database-store-everything:<0|1|false|true>
		- when non-zero the database is not testing for subscriptions and stores
		  everything (core network nodes are typically configured as such)
		- default is 0 when parameter is missing, 1 if no value is provided
	- database-xor-mask-size:<N>
		- used on first start, defines size of random xor mask used subsequently
		  to xor database content files on read and write
			- the purpose is to mask data against simple full-disk searches
			  for anything discrediting, regardless the author of such data
		- default is 256, set to 0 to keep database unencrypted

RADDI.com utility additional and optional parameters to functions:
	- instance:<pid>
		- specifies active instance, identified by PID number, to operate on
		- otherwise first instance found is used, searched in following order:
			1) raddi node service
			2) raddi node running under same user account
			3) raddi node running under other user account
		- applies to every function, except:
			- timestamp, microtimestamp, benchmark
	- text:<text>
		- <text> is converted to UTF-8 and appended to content of the new entry
		  without adding any additional characters
		- applies to:
			- new:identity, new:channel, new:thread, reply
	- content:<*×N|@path[@offset[:length]]|hexadecimal>
		- content is retrieved and translated per specification and appended to
		  content of the new entry, applicable specifications follow:
		- hexadecimal
			- string of two-character hexadecimal values optionally separated
			  by any non-hexadecimal character; translated to string of bytes
			  with specified values
		- *×N
			- variable number (N) of star (*) characters, i.e.: content:***
			- requests user input from command line
			- input terminates after N consecutive LF characters, trailing
			  LF characters are not included in the content
		- @path[@offset[:length]]
			- single (@) character followed by path to a file that is append
			  whole as-is to current content
			- optionally can also include offset and length if only a portion
			  the file is to be used; if length is not specified, until the
			  end of the file is assumed
		- applies to:
			- new:identity, new:channel, new:thread, reply
	- complexity:L,T,...
		- overrides CC PoW complexity requirements
		- parameter consists of series of decimal numbers separated by non-digits
		  where values in range 18...32 override the complexity level and higher
		  values override minimal time needed to compute the PoW in milliseconds
		- NOTES:
			- failure to meet minimal complexity requirements will result in
			  other nodes rejecting the entries
			- as the complexity level requirements are expected to increase
			  in the future, the minimal time value ensure that appropriately
			  increased level is applied even when older software is used or
			  the developers are lazy to re-tune the levels
		- applies to:
			- new:identity, new:channel, new:thread, reply
	- identity:*
	- identity:<iid>:*
	- identity:<iid>:<key>
	- identity:<iid>:@path[@offset[:length]]
		- provides the identity identifier of the entry author and key to sign
		  the entry with to verify authenticity
		- parts of the parameter are similar to 'content' parameter, see above
			- use star (*) character to request either the identity
			  description string, or just the key, from the command-line
			- use at (@) character to read identity key from a file
		- the utility verifies that the identity already exists in the database
		  and that the key is actually correct before continuing because wrongly
		  signed entry would only be rejected by other nodes
		- easiest use is to just provide output of the 'new:identity' command
		- applies to:
			- new:channel, new:thread, new:thread, reply
	- verify-identity-private-key:<0|1|false|true>
		- performs additional validation of the key before creating new entry

		  listing filter for list:threads command
		- applies to:
			- new:thread, list:threads
	- quick:<0|1|false|true>
		- setting to true for 'erase' function, the deletion will not be thorough
		  i.e. only index entry is deleted; normally the content is overwritten
		  with zero bytes
		- applies to:
			- erase
	- threshold:<timestamp>
		- timestamp of oldest data requested
		- the threshold is purely advisory, peers will generally return older
		  data if it is necessary to return whole thread, or reduce the threshold
		  if there's too much data
		- applies to:
			- download
	- names:<0|1|false|true>
		- specifies whether the content of the enumerated entries is parsed for
		  simple name, which is then displayed
		- setting to 'false' will significantly speed up the enumeration
		- generally defaults to 'true'
		- applies to:
			list:identities, list:channels, list:threads
	- oldest:<hexadecimal>
	- latest:<hexadecimal>
		- 
		- when omitted, no listing restriction takes place
