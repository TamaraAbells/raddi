RADDI.net protocol overview
===========================								|

This specification is work in progress and subject to significant changes and extensions.

Initial handshake
-----------------

Proposal (basically randomly generated data)
|  IN KEY | OUT KEY |  IN NONCE | OUT NONCE |
|   32B   |   32B   |    24B    |    24B    |

OUT NONCE, byte 7 (eight), bit 0 (LSB)
 - 1 - AES-256-GCM available
 - 0 - AES-256-GCM not available or disabled

AES is used only when both parties signal the bit. In both direction in that case.

In/Out keys are established using D-H from IN KEY and OUT KEY. The protocol uses distinct
keys/nonces for each direction.
Nonces are added to establish final nonces used for encryption/decryption of frames.
Nonces are incremented every time a frame is sent/received in particular direction.

Communication
-------------

KEEP ALIVE TOKENS
raddi_connection.cpp/.h
Exchanged when there is quiet on the connection for some time.

0x0000 - keep alive request
0xFFFF - keep alive response (chosen intentionally to fit whole valid frame into 64 kB)

Tokens with value of 16 and higher represent FRAME, see below. Smaller values terminate
connection.


FRAMING
raddi_protocol.cpp/.h
Each message exchanged within the established connection is preceeded by FRAMING data.

| FRAMING  |
| CB | AES |
| 2B | 16B | ...

CB - amount of data, in bytes, following the two CB bytes
AES - authentication tag of ChaCha20-Poly1305 or AES256-GCM

The additional authenticated data for AEAD construction are the two CB bytes. The rest of
the frame is encrypted using the keys/nonces generated in the initial handshake. Nonce is
incremented each time a frame is sent/received in that direction. Following documentation
described data in their decrypted form:


REQUEST
raddi_request.cpp/.h
Valid when CB is range 20 ~ 153 inclusive.

| FRAMING  | REQUEST | CONTENT |
| CB | AES | RQ | TL |         |
| 2B | 16B | 1B | 3B |    ~    |


ENTRY
raddi_entry.cpp/.h
Valid when CB is range 154 ~ 65534 inclusive.

| FRAMING  | HEADER                                  | CONTENT | PROOF OF WORK         |
|          |      ID      |  PARENT ID   | SIGNATURE |         |                       |
| CB | AES | Te | Tc | NN | Te | Tc | NN |           |         | NUL | EDGE...    | FT |
| 2B | 16B | 4B | 4B | 4B | 4B | 4B | 4B |    64B    |    ~    | 1B  | 4B × 2 × N | 1B |
